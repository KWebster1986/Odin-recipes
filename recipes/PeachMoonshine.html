   <p1> Summer afternoons around the camper or at the pool occasionally calls for a 
    relaxing drink. One of my favorite adult beverages happens to be moonshine and <a href="https://www.ozarkdistillery.com/"

    moonshine offers a lot of options!! On this post I'll be sharing recipes I make with their peach
    flavor!
    If you are ever in the <strong>Lake of The Ozarks, Missouri</strong> area, take an afternnon and visit the distillery. They offer tastings and a full 
    resturant. You can also schedule a tour!! Its a neat experiance and a great way to spend an afternoon in the AC.

    <h2>Peaches and Cream</h2>
    <img src="../img/peach2.jpg" alt="peach drink in a mug by peabody" width="30%"> <h4><em>Culinary Concoctions By Peabody</em></h4>
    <p2>This simple and refreshing drink is super easy and you can keep
        all the ingredients in a small travel cooler. Yay camping!!!
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of cream soda</li>
            <li>2oz of peach moonshine</li>
        </ul>
    </p2>

    <h2>Peachy Keen</h2>

    Another super easy summer drink I love is peach tea and peach moonshine. 
    This one is a little less deliberate in exicution so please bear with me.
     <ol>
        <li> Make or buy your favorite peach ice tea and put in into a pitch just a little too big.<em> We need room!!</em></li>
        <li> Grab you peach moonshine and give it a pour!! I tend to be a little heavy handed here but that's not always a bad thing</li>
        <li> Cut up a fresh peach and garnish the top of the pitcher and any glasses you plan to use</li>
        <li> Pour your lovely tea into glasses and serve to guests!</li>
     </ol>

    Contrary to what this project might suggest i am not much of a drinker. While I do 
    enjoy a drink while camping I do keep it really simple. I have not tried this recipe 
    but I think it looks good so I might try it. Mind you this recipe is a bit more complicated 
    than my camping drinks so you will need a few more things.
     <ul>
        <li>Dry white wine- something called a <em> Sauvignon Blanc</em> or <em> Pinot Grigio</em></li>
        <li>Peach Moonshine- <strong> You already know my favorite</strong></li>
        <li>Lemonade Concentrate</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Lemon-Lime Soda</li>
        <li>Fresh or Frozen Raspberries</li>
        <li>Fresh or Frozen Peaches</li>
     </ul>
    Ok so lets try mixing this up over at <a href="https://www.realhousemoms.com/peach-lemonade-sangria/" target="_blank" rel="norefferer"> RealHouseMoms </a> !!
