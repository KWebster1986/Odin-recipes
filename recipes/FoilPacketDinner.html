    <h1>Foil Dinner Packets- the easiest camp dinner ever!!</h1>
    <p1>I've been camping since I was a kids and in recent years i have had the joy of sharing that
        with my own kids. Let's be honset though, camping hits different when you are the adult, or parent, in charge. 
        Meal planning can be one of the hardest things for me because planning me forgets that after a full day of 
        bike riding and pool adventures I am not going to be as ambisous as I am when I am just planning away. 
        So here is one of my favorite easy camp dinners! Mind you this is usually done over an open fire but you 
        can do them in an oven. I also tend to just let the kids fill their own packets because they are much less 
        likely to complain.  
    </p1>
    <h3>For this recipe you will need:</h3>
    <p2>
        <h5>Tools and Utensils</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Aluminium foil- I tend to use the heavy duty one but you can probably use whatever</li>
          <li>Tongs or sticks- You will need these to remove them from the coals if you are cooking
          over a fire.</li>
          <li>Baking sheet and oven mit- in case you are making these in an oven</li>                  
        </ul>
        <h5>Food Items</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat or Meat Substitue- I have never done this with meat substitute so 
                if you are using one please be mindful of cooking requirements. You can use just 
                about any type of meat for these so be creative.</li>
            <li>Veggies- We like carrots, beans, corn, and celery most of the time 
                but again this is up to you and you can get creative. I do tend to prefer 
                fresh or frozen veggies to canned, but any of them will work. </li> 
            <li>Butter- I like mine with a little butter in my veggies</li>
            <li>Broth or water- You wont be able to use a whole lot of water but you will
                want to use enough that you dont burn your dinner.</li>       
        </ul>
    </p2>
    <h3>How to build you packet!</h3>
    <p3>Making a packet dinner is super easy! Even your littlest camper can help cook their own
        dinner!! 
        <ol>
            <li>Set out 3 sheets of foil for each dinner. We usually just stack them so we take up less space. </li>
            <li>Place your meat, veggies, and a slice of butter in the middle of your first layer of foil.
                The hard part here is not to over pack your packet. You will need to be able to fold over and seal 
                your packet.</li>
            <li>Once you have your meal all in the center of your packet it is time to start sealing it up. Start by
                folding two opposite sides over the top and rolling the seam. Next take one end and roll toward your food.
                When you have only one side open you want to add your broth or water. It's just a splash, don't over do it.</li>
            <li>Fold your open end in and flip your packet seam side down onto the next sheet of foil and fold that sheet. Make sure to 
                fold each layer of foil on opposite edges to the seams of the layer before. This will help seal ashes out.</li>
            <li>When you have 2-3 layers of foil sealing your packet you are ready to toss it in the fire. Some folks like to bury
                their packet in the coals and others just add wood on top and let nature handle the cooking. I lean toward the latter,
                why rush when I'm camping. Alternitivly you could just skip the fire and toss them in an oven if you have one.  </li>
            <li>This next step is tricky because you need to make sure it's cooked before you pull it out but you also don't want to burn
                your dinner. Chicken usually takes less time to cook than beef but it has to be fully cooked where are steaks and be medium.
                Use your grown up judgement here and don't eat undercooked food that will make you or your family sick.  </li>
            <li>Now we need to get them out. If you use the oven method this is simple as grabbing and oven mitt but grabbing them from 
                a fire can be tricky. If you planned ahead you might have long grilling tongs that will work great for this.
                otherwise you might be stuck trying to flip them out of the fire with a couple of sticks. Don't worry the edges of
            the foil cool quickly.</li>
            <li>Time to open them and eat!! Be careful of the steam and have adults or older kids help little ones!</li>                        
        </ol>
